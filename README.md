# LeetcodeDSAUsingJAVA 🚀

This repository contains Java solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems, curated from [**Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet**](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2/). The goal is to build a strong foundation in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using clean, readable, and optimized Java code.

Whether you're a beginner just getting started or someone preparing for coding interviews, this repo will serve as a valuable learning and revision resource.
